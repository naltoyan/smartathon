# smartathon


This is the repository for 4 group members participating in a hackathon: SMARTATHON.

It solves the problem of detecting visual pollution using machine learning.

We split the project into 2 parts: 1_Detection, and 2_Classification

Due size issues, the model is not included.

Thanks!
